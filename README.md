# StartPage

## What is StartPage?

A startpage is the page you first see when you open your browser or open a new tab (sometimes homepage).
This is a custom startpage template for links of favourite sites.

## Features

+ Themes

It has two themes: Green and Gray
You can check them here: [**Demo**](https://mlvnt.github.io/StartPage/)

It looks like this:

And it's responsive:

+ Integrated Search

By typing `comand + "search content"` in the search bar you can search directly in several sites.
If you want to view the list of available comands on the StartPage simply type `?` in the search bar.
If you don't use any of this comands the query you type is going to be processed by the default search engine - Google.

| Comand      | Corresponding Sites          |

## How to install?

Go to your browser's homepage settings and replace the current homepage with the
directory on your local machine in which your StartPage is stored. 

OR

Install the Chrome extention New Tab Redirect to replace the new tab with StartPage.
