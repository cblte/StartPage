# StartPage

## What is StartPage?

This is custom startpage for your browser.
It features two themes: Green and Gray.

You can check the Green Theme here:
**Demo:** [Green Theme](https://mlvnt.github.io/StartPage/)

It looks like this:

And it's responsive:

## How to install?

Go to your browser's homepage settings and replace the current homepage with the
directory on your local machine in which your StartPage is stored. 

OR

Install the Chrome extention New Tab Redirect to replace the new tab with StartPage.

And you're ready to go :-)
